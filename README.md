# Strabismusdetector
Strabismusdetector is a Python program that detects strabismus in a person looking into the camera at run time. It can currently be lauched from Linux Terminal. However, I am currently working to make it a web application accessible to any computer in the world. 
# How it works
The programs reads video frames from camera present in the computer and process each frame to detect a person's face and the Iris land marks using media pipe framework using ir. It obtains the iris land-marks using iris_landmark tensorflowlite neural network model. Once it obtains iris land-marks the program calculates the distances of right iris and left iris from a symmetrical line on the face. If these two distances are equal to some approximation, then the speciman video do not have strabismus. If there is a significant difference between the two distances, then there is a high chance of strabismus.
# Intended use
Strabismus, an eye misalignment sometimes found in children, typically requires a testing process by an eye specialist to be detected. However, its symptoms are often initially overlooked due to a lack of access to an eye specialist who can treat strabismus, a lack of awareness of the condition, or a type of misalignment that is harder to detect with general observation (such as very small or occasional deviations from the correct alignment). Early detection can prevent irreversible damage including permanent loss of depth perception. This tool is therefore intended to aid in early detection of strabismus to help people pursue diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.
