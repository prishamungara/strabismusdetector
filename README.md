# strabismusdetector
Strabismusdetector is a python program that detects presence of strabismus of a person looking into the camera at run time.Currently it can be lauched from Linux Terminal. However, there is work in progress to make it a web application to make it accessible from any computer in the world. 
# how it works
The programs reads video frames from camera present in the computer and process each frame to detect a person's face and the Iris land marks using media pipe framework using ir. It obtains the iris land-marks using iris_landmark tensorflowlite neural network model. Once it obtains iris land-marks the program calculates the distances of right iris and left iris from a symmetrical line on the face. If these two distances are equal to some approximation, then the speciman video do not have strabismus. If there is a significant difference between the two distances, then there is a high chance of strabismus.
# how this tool is useful
Typically strabismus require a complex testing process by an eye specialist to confirm its presence. The condition can be corrected/cured easily if detected early. However, many people my not be visiting the eye specialist because they do not see a reason visit the doctor until the later stages where the deviation is very much noticeable by others. Also in the early stages the deviation is not that obvious and may not happen all the time. Hence, this tool can be used to detect the strabismus early and see if the person needs to eye specialist or not.
